### Phase 2 - Convert to Angular 5
* Convert the static HTML application to use Angular 5
* Convert any "data" to mocked service implementations that return that data.
* Continue to implement features as requested (see the Projects page for more information)

### Phase 3 - Add a Backend
* Build a serverside application
* Convert all mocked service implementations from Phase 2 to be returned from the backend instead.
* Continue to implement features as requested (see the Projects page for more information)
